title: Let's Get This Party Started
---
This is my first blog entry. We'll see where it all leads to.

I am a bad frontend developer and basically don't have a clue how CSS
works. (Well, I have a clue but I didn't wanted to get into it yet.) I
get along with JavaScript alright, but I do not have much experience
to write dedicated stuff for the browser. Also, I like static
websites. Hence, I decided to give [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] a try.

So far it has a good feel to it. Nice thing is, that because of [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]]
I can write blog posts in any markup language.

I initiated this site with Hakyll's stack template and moved it to a
pure cabal project backed by [[https://nixos.org/nix/][nix]].
